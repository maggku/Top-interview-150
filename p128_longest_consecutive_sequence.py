"""
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3



Constraints:

    0 <= nums.length <= 105
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
